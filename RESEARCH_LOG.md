# Research Log

## 2025-01-05 — Kickoff
- Surveyed LLM landscape and developer tools (MCP, Claude Code, OpenAI API).
- Defined research questions around intent extraction, endpoint planning, and evaluation.

## 2025-03-15 — TMDB joins & formatting
- Implemented multi-entity join logic for TMDB.
- Added result validation, reranking, and flexible templates (list, timeline, comparison, fact).

## 2025-04-20 — TMDB Phase 1 completion
- Completed progressive constraint relaxation system with comprehensive logging.
- Validated multi-entity joins across movie/TV domains with role-aware validation.
- Demonstrated semantic + symbolic retrieval for complex queries.

## 2025-05-15 — NetBox MCP research phase
- Evaluated NetBox MCP server architecture and tool landscape (142+ tools across DCIM/Virtualization/IPAM).
- Identified performance bottlenecks: token overflow on large responses, N+1 query patterns.
- Began integration testing with Claude Code MCP protocol.

## 2025-06-30 — Performance optimization discoveries  
- Documented critical VLAN query issue: 127 API calls for 63 VLANs (N+1 pattern).
- Researched batch processing approaches and parallel HTTP request strategies.
- Designed knowledge-graph ingestion plan to pre-compute relationships.

## 2025-08-05 — Production integration milestone
- Successfully integrated Claude Code with NetBox MCP server in production environment.
- Validated enterprise-grade safety controls and dry-run capabilities.
- Documented pagination/token constraints and drafted comprehensive four-phase optimization plan.

## 2025-08-10 — Research documentation phase
- Created professional meta portfolio repository following GitHub best practices.
- Established MkDocs Material documentation site with Architecture Decision Records.
- Documented reproducible demo scenarios and evaluation methodologies.
