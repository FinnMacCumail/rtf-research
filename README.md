## Research Overview: Systematic Anti-Hallucination in Domain-Specific LLM Applications

This repository documents RTF's comprehensive 6-month research program addressing the critical challenge of **LLM hallucination in domain-specific applications**. Through systematic development of constraint-based validation, multi-protocol tool orchestration, and enterprise safety controls, this research demonstrates how to achieve reliable, factually accurate LLM responses in complex technical domains.

## Research Methodology: Multi-Protocol Anti-Hallucination System

### Problem Definition
Traditional LLM applications suffer from hallucinationâ€”generating plausible but factually incorrect responses, particularly problematic in technical domains where accuracy is critical. This research systematically addresses hallucination through structured validation approaches.

### Phase 1: TMDB RAG API Routing + Constraint-Based Validation Pipeline

**Query Processing Architecture:**
```
User Query â†’ Intent Recognition â†’ RAG API Endpoint Routing â†’ Entity Resolution (TMDB Search API) â†’ Constraint Building â†’ API Execution â†’ Response Validation
```

**Intent Recognition & Classification:**
- **LLM + SpaCy Integration**: Hybrid approach using language model understanding with structured linguistic analysis
- **Query Type Classification**: Movie search, person lookup, relationship queries, temporal constraints
- **Ambiguity Detection**: Identifies unclear queries requiring user clarification to prevent assumption-based responses

**RAG API Endpoint Routing Process:**
- **ChromaDB Vector Database**: Semantic search across 54 TMDB API endpoint descriptions for optimal routing
- **Sentence Transformers**: Query-to-vector conversion using all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model enabling similarity matching between user queries and API capabilities
- **Endpoint-Based Routing**: Vector similarity scores determine which TMDB APIs to call (e.g., /discover vs /search vs /person)
- **Semantic API Matching**: Retrieved endpoint embeddings guide query routing to prevent incorrect API usage

**Entity Resolution & Validation:**
- **TMDB Search API Integration**: Actors, directors, movies, genres resolved through TMDB Search API calls
- **Multi-Stage Entity Resolution**: Search API calls resolve "Tom Hanks" â†’ person_id, then cross-reference validation
- **API-Verified Entity Resolution**: All entities validated through TMDB database lookups with constraint building

**Weighted Endpoint Selection Algorithm:**
- **Decision Matrix**: Routes between `/discover/movie`, `/person`, `/search` based on:
  - Query complexity coefficient (0.0-1.0)
  - Entity confidence levels (weighted average)
  - Expected result quality metrics
  - API endpoint performance characteristics
  - Weighted Endpoint Selection: Static scoring system optimizes API
  routing using semantic similarity and rule-based parameter matching

**Progressive Constraint Relaxation:**
- **Constraint Hierarchy**: Primary (must match) â†’ Secondary (should match) â†’ Tertiary (nice to have)
- **Systematic Fallbacks**: Expands date ranges, relaxes genre constraints, broadens search scope
- **Provenance Logging**: Complete audit trail of which constraints were modified and why

### Phase 2: NetBox MCP + Claude Code API Integration

**MCP Protocol Architecture:**
- **Tool Discovery Process**: Claude Code API automatically discovers 142+ NetBox MCP tools
- **Capability Advertisement**: Each tool declares parameters, return types, and safety constraints
- **Dynamic Registration**: Real-time tool availability detection and capability matching

**Claude Code API Integration Patterns:**
- **Query-to-Tool Mapping**: Natural language intent parsed and matched to appropriate MCP tools
- **Parameter Validation Pipeline**: Input sanitization, type checking, constraint validation
- **Multi-Tool Orchestration**: Intelligent sequencing of tool calls for complex queries
- **Response Aggregation**: Structured data combination with conflict resolution

**Read-Only Tool Execution Safety:**
- **Idempotent Operations**: All read tools guaranteed to have no side effects
- **Dual-Tool Validation**: "info" + "list_all" tools provide cross-verification
- **Structured Response Enforcement**: MCP schema validation prevents fabricated data structures
- **Context-Aware Safety Levels**: Environment detection (demo/staging/production) with appropriate controls

**Anti-Hallucination MCP Mechanisms:**
- **Real-Time Data Binding**: Direct NetBox API integration eliminates data staleness
- **Atomic Validation**: Read-validate-confirm pattern for all infrastructure queries  
- **Enterprise Safety Controls**: Mandatory confirmation for write operations, comprehensive audit logging
- **Automatic Rollback**: Complex operations with built-in failure recovery

### Cross-Phase Validation Results

**Quantitative Anti-Hallucination Metrics:**
- **NetBox Phase**: 100% tool accessibility with structured response validation
- **Performance Optimization**: 127 API calls â†’ 3 calls through intelligent tool orchestration (97.6% reduction)
- **Enterprise Safety**: Zero fabricated infrastructure data across production environments

**Key Research Innovations:**
1. **RAG-Powered API Orchestration**: Novel use of semantic search for API endpoint selection rather than content retrieval
2. **Semantic Query Routing**: Vector similarity matching user queries to optimal TMDB API endpoints from 54 endpoint descriptions
3. **Progressive Relaxation with Provenance**: Systematic fallbacks maintaining accuracy audit trails
4. **MCP Protocol Safety Integration**: Structured tool protocols eliminating response fabrication
5. **Multi-Protocol API Intelligence**: Seamless integration of semantic endpoint routing with enterprise tool safety

## Technical Implementation Highlights
