# AI Research Portfolio (2025)

This repository is the hub for RTF's ongoing research exploring LLM-driven developer tooling,
symbolic/semantic retrieval, and multi-step planning. It curates findings, decisions,
and demos across two phases:

- **Phase 1 â€“ TMDB Chatbox**
  - Repository: https://github.com/FinnMacCumail/tmdbGPT
  - Focus: intent/entity extraction, hybrid retrieval (semantic + symbolic metadata),
    multi-step planning, endpoint selection, and response formatting using the TMDB API.

- **Phase 2 â€“ NetBox MCP + Claude Code**
  - Repository: https://github.com/FinnMacCumail/mcp-netbox
  - Status: Production-ready NetBox MCP server with 142+ tools; optimizing performance for
    token overflow and N+1 query issues (VLAN queries: 127 calls â†’ optimized batching).
  - Focus: Enterprise-grade safety controls, pagination strategies, and knowledge-graph
    approaches for network operations chat workflows.

ðŸ‘‰ **Full documentation & research log:** see GitHub Pages (configured via MkDocs).

## Highlights
- Symbolic + semantic retrieval for tool/endpoint selection
- Multi-entity joins and constraint-aware planning
- Pagination and token-boundary strategies for large responses
- Knowledge-graph plans to reduce N+1 API calls (NetBox)
- Reproducible demos, ADRs, and evaluation notes

## Implementation Repositories
- **Phase 1**: TMDB Chatbox â€“ https://github.com/FinnMacCumail/tmdbGPT
- **Phase 2**: NetBox MCP Server â€“ https://github.com/FinnMacCumail/mcp-netbox

## Future Development
A comprehensive four-phase OpenAI orchestration plan exists to transform Phase 2 into an intelligent infrastructure advisor:
1. **Foundation**: GPT-4o-mini intent parsing with LangGraph tool orchestration
2. **Graph Integration**: Neo4j database for instant complex queries (1-3s vs 30s-3min)
3. **RAG Intelligence**: Institutional memory with operational documentation
4. **Analytics Platform**: Predictive capabilities using graph algorithms

**Performance Targets**: 99% cost reduction, 15-50x query performance improvements

## Getting Started
- Edit the docs under `docs/` and push to `main`. GitHub Actions will publish to Pages.
- See `RESEARCH_LOG.md` for dated findings and pivots.
- See `docs/adr/` for architecture decisions.
