# Retrieval & Planning Methods

- **Hybrid Retrieval**: combine semantic similarity with symbolic metadata filters
- **Symbolic Planner**: select endpoints/tools based on detected entities, roles, and constraints
- **Constraint Trees**: AND/OR logic across roles (cast, director), companies/networks, and scalars
- **Fallbacks**: inject lookups for dependent steps; relax constraints with provenance logging
