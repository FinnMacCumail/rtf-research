# Phase 1 Implementation Details

## Technical Architecture

The TMDB chatbox implements a sophisticated natural language processing pipeline combining semantic understanding with symbolic constraint solving.

### Core Components

**ChromaDB Integration**
- Semantic search using sentence transformers for similarity matching
- Vector embeddings for movie/TV show titles, actor names, and genre classifications
- Efficient retrieval of relevant entities based on natural language queries

**Multi-Entity Constraint Engine**
```python
# Example constraint resolution for complex queries
query = "Movies starring Leonardo DiCaprio directed by Martin Scorsese"
constraints = {
    'actors': ['Leonardo DiCaprio'],
    'directors': ['Martin Scorsese'],
    'media_type': 'movie'
}
# Progressive relaxation if no results found
```

**Progressive Constraint Relaxation**
- Initial strict matching across all detected entities and roles
- Systematic relaxation when no results found (e.g., expand date ranges, relax secondary constraints)
- Provenance logging to track which constraints were modified
- Fallback mechanisms for graceful degradation

### API Integration Patterns

**Dynamic Endpoint Selection**
- Intelligent routing between `/discover/movie`, `/person`, `/search` based on query intent
- Parameter mapping from natural language entities to TMDB API parameters
- Role-aware validation ensuring cast/crew relationships are correctly identified

**Result Validation & Reranking**
- Post-processing validation to ensure results match original query intent
- Semantic reranking using embedding similarity scores
- Template-based formatting (list, timeline, comparison, fact-based responses)

### Performance Optimizations

**Caching Strategy**
- Intelligent caching of TMDB API responses with TTL management
- Semantic cache for similar queries using vector similarity
- Entity resolution cache to avoid repeated person/company lookups

**Batch Processing**
- Parallel API calls for multi-entity queries
- Efficient handling of large result sets with pagination
- Memory-efficient processing of constraint combinations
