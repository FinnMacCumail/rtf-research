# Comparative Analysis: Deepagents vs Claude SDK

## Overview

Side-by-side evaluation of both NetBox agent implementations across key dimensions.

For framework selection guidance, see [Selection Guide](../../framework-comparison/selection-guide.md).

## Quick Comparison Matrix

| Dimension | Deepagents | Claude SDK |
|-----------|-----------|------------|
| **Initial Development Time** | 46 hours | 2.5 hours |
| **Lines of Code** | ~1,200 | ~400 |
| **Monthly Maintenance** | 8-12 hours | 2-4 hours |
| **Flexibility** | Unlimited | Constrained by SDK |
| **Production Features** | DIY | Built-in |
| **Tool Integration** | Custom Python | MCP Protocol |
| **Safety Controls** | Custom Implementation | Managed by SDK |
