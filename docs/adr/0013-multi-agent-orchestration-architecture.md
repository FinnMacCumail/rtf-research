# ADR-0013 â€” Multi-Agent Orchestration Architecture

## Context

Phase 3 NetBox development requires intelligent coordination of existing NetBox MCP tools without modifying tool implementations. Two architectural approaches were considered:

1. **Monolithic Agent**: Single large agent handling all NetBox coordination tasks
2. **Multi-Agent System**: Specialized agents with clear role separation

## Decision

Implement a **5-agent orchestration system** with specialized roles:

- **Conversation Manager** (GPT-4o): Orchestrate multi-agent workflows and maintain session context
- **Intent Recognition Agent** (GPT-4o-mini): Parse user queries and classify NetBox operation intents  
- **Response Generation Agent** (GPT-4o-mini): Generate natural language responses from execution results
- **Task Planning Agent**: Decompose complex queries into coordinated tool execution sequences
- **Tool Coordination Agent**: Execute NetBox MCP tools with intelligent coordination

## Rationale

### Benefits of Multi-Agent Approach

1. **Role Clarity**: Each agent has single responsibility and clear boundaries
2. **Scalability**: Individual agents can be optimized independently
3. **Maintainability**: Easier debugging and development with isolated concerns
4. **Cost Efficiency**: Use GPT-4o-mini for specialized tasks, GPT-4o only for orchestration
5. **Failure Isolation**: Agent failures don't cascade across the entire system

### Rejected Monolithic Approach

- Single agent would require extensive prompting for all capabilities
- Higher token usage and costs with GPT-4o for all tasks
- Difficult to optimize individual capabilities
- Complex debugging and testing with monolithic logic

## Consequences

### Positive
- Clear separation of concerns enables focused development
- Cost optimization through strategic model selection
- Robust error handling with isolated failure domains
- Parallel processing capabilities for improved performance

### Negative
- Additional complexity in inter-agent communication
- Need for correlation ID system to track multi-agent workflows
- More complex deployment and monitoring requirements

## Implementation Notes

- Correlation IDs enable async coordination between agents
- Structured JSON messaging between agents for efficiency
- Session management maintains conversation context across agent interactions
- Interactive CLI testing validates multi-agent coordination patterns

## Success Metrics

- 100% integration test success rate across all agent coordination scenarios
- Sub-5 second response times for complex multi-agent workflows
- 85% cost reduction vs. all-GPT-4o approach through strategic model selection
